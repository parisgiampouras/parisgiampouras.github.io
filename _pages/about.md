I am an Assistant Professor of Machine Learning and AI in the [Department of Computer Science at the University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/), within the Foundations of AI and Machine Learning ([FAM](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/research/fam/)) division. I am also a Research Scientist at [FAIR, Meta AI](https://ai.meta.com/research/) (part-time), and an Affiliated Researcher at the [Archimedes AI Research Center](https://archimedesai.gr/en/).

Previously, I was a Research Faculty member at the [Mathematical Institute for Data Science (MINDS) at Johns Hopkins University](https://www.minds.jhu.edu), where I held a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellowship from 2019 to 2022.

My research interests span representation learning, deep generative models, continual learning, and trustworthy machine learning. More recently, my work has focused on AI safety and alignment, aligned diffusion models, and continual and agentic AI systems.

**I am a co-organizer of the [ReALM–GEN workshop at ICLR 2026](https://realm-gen-workshop.github.io/), which features an exciting lineup of invited speakers and panelists. Full details are available on the [workshop website](https://realm-gen-workshop.github.io/), and submissions are handled via [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc/2026/Workshop/ReALM-GEN).**



**I co-organize the [Foundations of AI Seminar (FAIS)](https://faiseminarswarwick.github.io) series. If you’d like to be considered as a future speaker, please [reach out](mailto:paris.giampouras@warwick.ac.uk)!**


**Prospective collaborators and students interested in working with me are highly encouraged to [e-mail](mailto:paris.giampouras@warwick.ac.uk) me!**
