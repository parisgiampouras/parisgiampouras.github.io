I am an Assistant Professor of ML/AI at the [Department of Computer Science, University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/), and an Affiliated Researcher at the [Archimedes AI Research Center](https://archimedesai.gr/en/). Previously, I was a Research Faculty member at the [Mathematical Institute for Data Science (MINDS) at Johns Hopkins University (JHU)](https://www.minds.jhu.edu). From 2019 to 2022, I held a Marie SkÅ‚odowska-Curie postdoctoral fellowship at MINDS. 

My research combines machine learning and signal processing, focusing on parsimonious representation learning and its applications in deep generative models, continual learning, and trustworthy ML. 

**I co-organize the [Foundations of AI Seminar (FAIS)](https://faiseminarswarwick.github.io) series. If youâ€™d like to be considered as a future speaker, please [reach out](mailto:paris.giampouras@warwick.ac.uk)!**


**Prospective collaborators and students interested in working with me are highly encouraged to [e-mail](mailto:paris.giampouras@warwick.ac.uk) me!**
