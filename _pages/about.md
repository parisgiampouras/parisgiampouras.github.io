PAGE UNDER CONSTRUCTION!!! I am a Research Faculty member of the Mathematical Institute for Data Science (MINDS) of the Johns Hopkins University working with Prof. Rene Vidal. 
My research interests span areas in machine learning and signal processing. My research endeavors focus on representation learning, deep generative models and continual learning. I aim to devise efficient and reliable algorithms for analyzing high-dimensional and large-scale datasets. My work is interdisciplinary and touches upon topics at the intersection of convex/nonconvex optimization theory, Bayesian inference, high-dimensional probability theory, image processing, computer vision and robust ML. My latest research interests are in theory and algorithms for inverse problems using pretrained deep generative models.
