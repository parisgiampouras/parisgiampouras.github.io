I am an Assistant Professor of ML/AI at the [Department of Computer Science, University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/), and an Affiliated Researcher at the [Archimedes AI Research Center](https://archimedesai.gr/en/). Previously, I was a Research Faculty member at the [Mathematical Institute for Data Science (MINDS) at Johns Hopkins University (JHU)](https://www.minds.jhu.edu). From 2019 to 2022, I held a Marie Skłodowska-Curie postdoctoral fellowship at MINDS. 

My research spans representation learning, deep generative models, continual learning, and trustworthy machine learning. Recently, I’ve been exploring AI safety and alignment, aligned diffusion models, and continual/agentic AI systems.

**I am a co-organizer of the [ReALM–GEN workshop at ICLR 2026](https://realm-gen-workshop.github.io/). We have an exciting line-up of invited speakers and panelists—full details are on the [workshop website](https://realm-gen-workshop.github.io/). Submissions are via [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc/2026/Workshop/ReALM-GEN).**


**I co-organize the [Foundations of AI Seminar (FAIS)](https://faiseminarswarwick.github.io) series. If you’d like to be considered as a future speaker, please [reach out](mailto:paris.giampouras@warwick.ac.uk)!**


**Prospective collaborators and students interested in working with me are highly encouraged to [e-mail](mailto:paris.giampouras@warwick.ac.uk) me!**
