I am an Assistant Professor of ML/AI at the Department of Computer Science, University of Warwick, and an Affiliated Researcher at the Archimedes AI Research Center. Previously, I was a Research Faculty member at the Mathematical Institute for Data Science (MINDS) at Johns Hopkins University (JHU). From 2019 to 2022, I held a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie postdoctoral fellowship at MINDS.

My research combines machine learning and signal processing, focusing on parsimonious representation learning and its applications in deep generative models, continual learning, and trustworthy ML.
