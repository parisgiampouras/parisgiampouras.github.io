I am a Research Faculty member of the Mathematical Institute for Data Science (MINDS) of the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) working with Prof. Rene Vidal. From 2019 to 2022 I was a Marie-Sklodowska Curie postdoctoral fellow affiliated with MINDS at JHU and the National Observatory of Athens, Greece. 
My research interests span areas in machine learning and signal processing. Specifically, I focus on parsimonious representation learning with applications to deep generative models and continual learning. My work is interdisciplinary and touches upon topics at the intersection of convex/nonconvex optimization theory, Bayesian inference, high-dimensional probability theory with applications to image processing, computer vision and trustworthy ML.
