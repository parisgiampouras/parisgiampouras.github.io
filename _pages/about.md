I am an Assistant Professor of ML/AI at the Department of Computer Science of the University of Warwick. Before that, I was a Research Faculty member at the Mathematical Institute for Data Science (MINDS) of Johns Hopkins University (JHU), working with Professor Rene Vidal. From 2019 to 2022, I held a Marie-Sklodowska Curie postdoctoral fellowship at MINDS at JHU. My research area is a combination of machine learning and signal processing, with a focus on parsimonious representation learning and its applications in deep generative models and continual learning. My work is interdisciplinary and encompasses topics such as convex/nonconvex optimization theory, Bayesian inference, high-dimensional probability theory with applications in image processing/computer vision, and trustworthy ML.
